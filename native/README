Android Application for Flite

This directory contains the native code for FliteEngine. Flite Libraries are
distributed in binary form here, but you can download flite from
www.cmuflite.org and compile them again. 

To compile this project, you need to build the native part first, then build
the Java project.


The native code part, which resides in Application.mk and project/...,
must be built with the Android NDK:

   unzip android-ndk.zip
   cd android-ndk

   cd apps
   ln -s /path/to/FliteEngine/native ./FliteEngine
   cd ..

   ./build/host-setup.sh

   make APP=FliteEngine

This will generate a file

   project/libs/armeabi/liblibttsfliteengine.so

which should be copied to

   libs/armeabi/libttsfliteengine.so

The Java part, which resides in AndroidManifest.xml and in src/...,
can be built using the ant script.
