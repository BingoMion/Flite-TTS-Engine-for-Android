Flite TTS Engine for Android
============================

This application provides the Flite (Festival lite) speech synthesizer for
android. To use this engine, you need to install the Eyes-free TTS library
available from Google. 


This distribution contains the native code and Java wrapper for
FliteEngine. Source code to compile Flite and the voices is not included here,
but you can download "flite" from www.cmuflite.org.  

To compile this project, you need to build the native part first, then build
the Java project.

The native code part, which resides in jni/...,
must be built with the Android NDK:

 ~$  export FLITEDIR=/path/to/flite
 ~$  export ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/ANDROID_NDK_R4

 ~$  $ANDROID_NDK/ndk-build

The Java part, which resides in AndroidManifest.xml and in src/...,
can be built using the ant script.

 ~$ ant debug
