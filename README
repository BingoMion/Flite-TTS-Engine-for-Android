Flite TTS Engine for Android
============================

This application provides the Flite (Festival lite) speech synthesizer for
android. To use this engine, you need to install the Eyes-free TTS library
available from Google. 


This distribution contains the native code and Java wrapper for
FliteEngine. Source code to compile Flite and the voices is not included here,
but you can download it from www.cmuflite.org.  

To compile this project, you need to build the native part first, then build
the Java project.

The native code part, which resides in Application.mk and project/...,
must be built with the Android NDK:

   unzip android-ndk.zip
   cd android-ndk

   cd apps
   ln -s /path/to/FliteEngine/native ./FliteEngine
   cd ..

   ./build/host-setup.sh

   make APP=FliteEngine

This will generate a file

   project/libs/armeabi/liblibttsfliteengine.so

which should be copied to

   libs/armeabi/libttsfliteengine.so

The Java part, which resides in AndroidManifest.xml and in src/...,
can be built using the ant script.
